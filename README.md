## 📐 Object Structure and Data Source

The data used in this application is fetched locally as mocked data. This approach ensures fast performance and allows for easy inspection, particularly suited for the purpose of this technical challenge. 

For this implementation, the data is not served through a remote API (e.g., GraphQL or REST) to focus on the UI/UX and functionality aspects. However, the architecture is flexible enough to integrate with a backend service in the future.

The application reads objects that are structured as follows:

{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  priority: string;
  estimatedShippingDate: string;
  orderDescription: string;
  orderDetails: {
    part: string;
    partNumber: string;
    releaseStatus: string;
    drawingNumber: string;
    flightArticle: string;
  };
  processDetails: {
    material: string;
    materialStockSize: string;
    surfaceTreatment: string;
    machine: string;
  };
  files: [
    {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      category: string;
      thumbnail: string;
      date: string;
      description: string;
      type: string;
    }
  ];
  tags: string[];
  isDeleted: boolean;
}

### Note:
- The data was generated using AI-based models for simulation purposes.
- This format ensures flexibility and scalability to support advanced features.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Additional)

- **🚀 Backend Integration with GraphQL**:
  - Have a backend service deployed online, utilizing **GraphQL** with **Apollo Server**, to enable efficient and seamless data fetching. This will involve creating a schema to represent the Kanban data structure and defining resolvers to handle specific queries and mutations. By integrating this backend, the application will leverage the power of GraphQL to fetch only the necessary data, simplify complex data operations, and enhance scalability.
  
- **📦 Component Unification**:
  - Refactor and simplify reusable components such as titles, selects, tooltips, buttons and inputs for consistency.
  - Enhance the Material-UI theme with variables for colors, sizes, and other styling options to ensure maintainability and scalability.

- **🎯 Advanced Drag-and-Drop**:
  - Allow cards to be dragged and dropped not just into columns but also reordered within the target column based on the position where they are dropped.
  (Currently, cards are moved to the bottom of the target column)

- **🧪 Extended Testing**:
  - Write more comprehensive test cases to cover edge cases, improve reliability, and ensure robustness across all features.
